Accompanying code for guided tour of arts programming platforms talk by Becky Stewart.  Slides are available at http://slideshare.net/beckystewart


Processing
----------
Download the platform and programming environment from 
http://processing.org

You can move ./processingExample to your Processing sketchbook, or run it from its current location by double-clicking on processingExample.pde.


openFrameworks
--------------
Download the platform and follow the installation instructions at
http://www.openframeworks.cc/

Follow the instructions in the oF readme for creating a new project.  Copy and create a new app from the emptyExample and move it to the folder of your apps within openFrameworks.  Either move the included source files ./oFExample/main.cpp, ./oFExample/ofExample.cpp, ./oFExample/oFExample.h to your new project folder or import them with moving them from within your IDE.


Cinder
------
Download the platform and follow the installation instructions at
http://libcinder.org/

Create a new project the same way you would for openFrameworks.  

Duplicate the BasicApp folder in the Cinder samples and rename the folder to cinderExample.  Move this folder to where you would like put your Cinder apps - it should be in the same relative position as the samples folder.  Open the project in XCode (or other IDE) and rename the project to cinderExample.  In XCode, this is is done by clicking on the project name in the left hand column. 

Delete basicApp.cpp and add cinderExample/cinderExample.cpp to the project.
